## Where to Find These Sounds:

You can find Halo announcer sound effects from various sources online. Some popular options:

1. **Halo Sound Board websites** - Many fan sites have downloadable Halo sounds
2. **YouTube to MP3 converters** - Find Halo announcer compilation videos
3. **Game asset extraction** - Extract from Halo game files (if you own the game)
4. **Sound effect libraries** - Some sites host game sound effects

## Legal Note:

These sounds are copyrighted by Microsoft/343 Industries. Using them in a non-commercial fan project is generally tolerated by the community, but:

- Do NOT use for commercial purposes
- This is strictly for personal/fan use
- Give credit to Halo/Microsoft if you share the project

## File Format:

- Format: MP3 or WAV
- Recommended: MP3 for smaller file sizes
- The game will work without sounds (they'll just be silent)

## Optional:

If you can't find all the sounds, the game will still work! It will just skip playing the missing sounds. Start with the most common ones:

- doublekill.mp3
- triplekill.mp3
- overkill.mp3
- killtacular.mp3
- freeze.mp3
